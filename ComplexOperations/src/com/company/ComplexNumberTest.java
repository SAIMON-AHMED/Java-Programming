public class ComplexNumberTest {



    /*
Write the following methods (instance methods):
* Method named add with one parameter of type ComplexNumber. It needs to add the ComplexNumber parameter to the
corresponding instance variables.
* Method named subtract with two parameters real and imaginary of type double, it needs to subtract parameters
from fields, in other words, it needs to do a complex number subtract operation as described above.
* Method named subtract with one parameter other of type ComplexNumber. It needs to subtract the other
parameter from this complex number.


TEST EXAMPLE

→ TEST CODE:

ComplexNumber one = new ComplexNumber(1.0, 1.0);
ComplexNumber number = new ComplexNumber(2.5, -1.5);
one.add(1,1);
System.out.println("one.real= " + one.getReal());
System.out.println("one.imaginary= " + one.getImaginary());
one.subtract(number);
System.out.println("one.real= " + one.getReal());
System.out.println("one.imaginary= " + one.getImaginary());
number.subtract(one);
System.out.println("number.real= " + number.getReal());
System.out.println("number.imaginary= " + number.getImaginary());

→ OUTPUT

one.real= 2.0
one.imaginary= 2.0
one.real= -0.5
one.imaginary= 3.5
number.real= 3.0
number.imaginary= -5.0


NOTE: Try to avoid duplicated code.

NOTE: All methods should be defined as public NOT public static.

NOTE: In total, you have to write 6 methods.

NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.
